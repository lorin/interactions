# Interactions

Focus on the interactions, not the components.

> A society is the total network of relations between human beings. The components of society are thus not human beings but relations between them.

-- Alfred Toynbee, a Study of History


> Our lives succeed or fail gradually, then suddenly, one conversation at a time. While no single conversion is guaranteed to change the trajectory of a ceer, a business, a marriage, or a life, any single conversation can. The conversation is the relationship.

-- Susan Scott, Fierce Conversations


> Category theory is extreme in the sense that it actively discourages us from looking inside the objects. An object in category theory is an abstract nebulous entity. All you can ever know about it is how it relates to other object â€” how it connects with them using arrows. 

-- Bartosz Milewski, Category: The Essence of Computation
